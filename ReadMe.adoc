= Two-Phase Traffic Signal Simulation

== Overview

This project simulates a two-phase traffic signal on an 8 x 8 NeoPixel Matrix, controlled by a finite state machine (FSM). It's designed to showcase how traffic light control systems can be implemented using simple hardware and programming constructs.

== Author
Vishweswar Eswaran

== Features
Simulates traffic lights for two intersecting roads.
Uses FSM for controlling the sequence of traffic lights.
Visualizes traffic movement on an 8 x 8 NeoPixel Matrix.

== Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board.
8 x 8 NeoPixel Matrix.
Jumper wires for connections.

== Software Requirements
Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading the code to the microcontroller.
Adafruit_NeoPixel library.

== Installation
Setting Up the Hardware
Connect the NeoPixel matrix's DIN pin to pin 8 on the Arduino.
Connect the NeoPixel matrix's 5V and GND to the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino, respectively.

== Preparing the Software
Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Install the Adafruit_NeoPixel library via the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.
Open the provided code in the Arduino IDE.

== Usage
Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Once the code is uploaded, the simulation starts automatically.
Observe the traffic light sequence on the NeoPixel Matrix. The simulation visualizes traffic light changes and simulated vehicle movements for two phases of traffic signals.

== Simulation Details
The simulation operates in four main states:

=== START: 
Initial state where one set of traffic lights is green, and the other is red.

=== TRANSITION_Y: 
Transition state where the green lights turn yellow.

=== ALL_R: 
A brief state where all lights are red, simulating the all-red phase in real traffic signals to allow safe intersection clearance.

=== SHIFTED: 
The phase switches, and the traffic lights that were red turn green.
Vehicle movements are visualized on the matrix to correspond with the traffic light states, enhancing the simulation's realism.

== Contributing
Your contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to improve the simulation or suggest new features.
